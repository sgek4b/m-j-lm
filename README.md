webbrowser
==========

Webbrowser is a proxy script for launching the "best" available browser among those available on the local system. It searches for common browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc. and runs the first one it finds.

By configuring applications that launch a web browser with "webbrowser", you can avoid reconfiguring all such apps every time you switch browsers.
